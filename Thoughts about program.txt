why random, just determine what should be done in a x*z grid and apply a dot with and y size somewhere in there

make gif, directly in PILLOW? see the possibillities for PILLOW online

write this to c using the ideas from the anons on 4ch /g/

Multi threaded by not actyally applying the new pixels but saving them in a table and adding them to the picture later

place four or five dots per time, and see for all of them whether or not it improves the image, place all of them that are okay

it looks like one comparison per run is a duplicate of one comparison made last time, this could be improved, could double speed

MAKE LINES INSTEAD OF DOTS FOR IMPROVED VISUALS YEAH BOI



DOES NOT WORK:

-the comparison is the only one that has to do with the image size, and the time it takes seems to be higher for a bigger image, so that is the bottleneck 
	we could halve the image size and compare then?
-Snip image to a smaller image for comparing, worth it?
		image conversion takes longer than image compare anyway

Make threads once
	Does not work since a thread can only be started once, it really is a one function thing


PROFILING:

kernprof -l convert.py img_FRZ.jpg 2000 5 pprofile_FRZ_2K_5.png

to see results:

python -m line_profiler convert.py.lprof


or at once: REMEMBER TO UNCOMMENT THE @PROFILE TAGS YOU DUMB FUCK JEEZ!
